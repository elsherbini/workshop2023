## Wooclap {.your-turn}

## Malva pudding

![](images/malva.jpg){fig-alt="A picture of a malva pudding." fig-align="center" width="546"}

. . .

My friend told me that Malva puddings in Durban are usually much sweeter than those sold in Cape Town.

. . .

Is this true?

## Is my friend right?

Are Malva puddings in Durban sweeter than those in Cape Town?

. . .

How do we find out?

## Malva pudding and **hypothesis testing**

We have a claim:

"*Malva puddings in Durban are sweeter than those in Cape Town*".

. . .

We need to design and plan an **experiment** to collect data to test this claim.

. . .

Statistically, this is *hypothesis testing*.

## Hypothesis testing 🤔 {auto-animate="true"}

What is hypothesis testing? 🤔

. . .

> Hypothesis testing is a method for making *decisions* about the value of a population parameter.

. . .

-   A *population* is not necessarily a group of humans. In statistics, a population is a group of individuals, objects, or measurements that are of interest to us. For example: the population of Malva puddings in Durban.

. . .

-   A *population parameter* is a numerical value that describes a population. For example: the *average sugar* content of Malva puddings in Durban.

## Hypothesis testing is a critical step of the scientific method {auto-animate="true"}

-   State a claim that we want to verify (or disprove) 🤓

. . .

-   Design an experiment to test the claim 📝

. . .

-   Plan and execute the experiment (= collect the data) 🔎🔎

. . .

-   Exploratory analysis of the data and visualization 📈📈

. . .

-   **Hypothesis testing**

. . .

-   Interpretation (and predictions) 💁

## How many samples do we need?

Do we need to measure the sugar content of ALL Malva puddings in Durban and Cape Town?

🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮🥮

. . .

❌ No, we can to collect a *representative* sample from both populations.

. . .

💡 The number of samples we need to collect depends on the *variability* of sugar content in both populations and the *minimum difference* in sugar we want to detect.

. . .

🤓 Formally, we would need to do a **power analysis** to estimate the number of samples needed.

## Malva pudding data

Let's pretend we have done a power analysis. 🤫

. . .

→ We need to collect 20 samples from each "population"

. . .

We go to the lab and measure the sugar content of all 40 puddings. Let's display this data.

```{r}
#| echo: false

set.seed(123)
malva <- 
  bind_rows(
    tibble(town = "Durban", sugar = rbinom(20, 100, 0.35)),
    tibble(town = "Cape Town", sugar = rbinom(20, 100, 0.3))
  ) |> 
  mutate(
    town = town |> factor(levels = c("Durban", "Cape Town"))
    )

town_colors <- 
  c(
    "Cape Town" = "lightslateblue", 
    "Durban" = "mediumseagreen"
    )

g_malva_hist <- 
  ggplot(malva, aes(x = sugar, fill = town)) +
  geom_histogram(alpha = 0.5, position = "identity", bins = 30) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = town_colors) +
  xlab("Sugar (%)")

```

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
g_malva_hist
```

## Malva puddings: conclusions?

Let's compute the mean and standard deviation for both groups.

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
```{r}
g_malva_hist
```
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r}

malva %>% 
  group_by(town) %>% 
  summarise(`mean sugar (%)` = mean(sugar), `sd` = sd(sugar)) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, booktab = TRUE)

```
:::
:::

. . .

Do we think my friend was right?

. . .

🤔 Could it not be just by chance that the average sugar content in Durban is higher than in Cape Town?

## The Null and Alternative hypotheses.

Formally, in statistics, to do a test, we need to define a **pair of hypotheses**: the Null and the Alternative hypotheses.

. . .

⚖️ The Null hypothesis ($H_0$) is the "*status quo*" claim: usually, it assumes no effect, or no differences between groups.

For example, the average sugar content in Malva puddings is the same in both towns:

$$H_0: \mu_{C} = \mu_{D}$$

## The Null and Alternative hypotheses.

The alternative hypothesis ($H_a$) is the *complement* of the Null hypothesis. It is usually the hypothesis we want to prove.

. . .

Here:

$$H_a: \mu_C \neq \mu_D$$

## The Null and Alternative hypotheses.

We can do "two-sided" tests, like above, or "one-sided" tests.

. . .

In "one-sided" tests, the Null and Alternative hypotheses are of the form:

$$H_0: \mu_{C} \geq \mu_{D}$$ and

$$H_a: \mu_C < \mu_D$$

. . .

(or the reverse).

## The Null and alternative hypothesis for Malva puddings

![](images/malva.jpg){fig-alt="A picture of a malva pudding." fig-align="center" width="546"}

$$H_0: \mu_{D} \leq \mu_{C}$$ and

$$H_a: \mu_D > \mu_C$$

The alternative is my friend's claim (Malva puddings in Durban are sweeter than those in Cape Town).

## Is it enough to just compute the means?

```{r}
malva |> 
  group_by(town) |> 
  summarise(`mean sugar (%)` = mean(sugar), `sd` = sd(sugar)) |> 
  kableExtra::kable(digit = 2)

```

Would it be possible to observe these values if the Null hypothesis was true?

## The $p$-value

✨The $p$-value is the **probability** of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one we observed, *under the Null hypothesis*.

. . .

The $p$-value is a number between 0 and 1.

. . .

0 = impossible / never

1 = always

## Hypothesis testing: the test statistic

Remember:

The $p$-value is the probability of observing a **test statistic** as extreme as the one we observed, *under the Null hypothesis*.

. . .

🤔 What is a test statistics?

A **test statistic** is a numerical value that we compute from our data, and that we will use to make a decision about the Null hypothesis.

## Hypothesis testing: the test statistic

A **naive** test statistic for comparing means of two populations could be simply to compute the **difference in means**.

. . .

Under the Null (= assuming the Null is true and $\mu_D \leq \mu_C$), this difference should be small or below zero.

. . .

So a large positive value would be quite unlikely under the Null and have a small $p$-value.

## A less naive test statistic

A more sophisticated test statistic is the $t$-statistic which takes into account the *variability* in the data.

. . .

$$😱😱😱\ \ \ \  T  = \frac{\bar{x}_D - \bar{x}_C}{\sqrt{\frac{S^2_D}{n_D} + \frac{S^2_C}{n_C}}} \ \ \ \ 😱😱😱$$

. . .

IF

-   the two populations follow a normal distribution OR

-   the number of samples is larger than \~40 in each group

THEN this $T$ test statistics follows a $t$ distribution.

## Back to the pudding data

Let's compute the $t$-statistic for the Malva pudding data.

::: columns
::: {.column width="35%"}
```{r}
g_malva_hist
```
:::

::: {.column width="65%"}
```{r}

malva %>% 
  group_by(town) %>% 
  summarise(`mean sugar (%)` = mean(sugar), `sd` = sd(sugar)) |> 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2, booktab = TRUE)

```
:::
:::

```{r}

mean_diff <- 
  mean(malva$sugar[malva$town == "Durban"]) - mean(malva$sugar[malva$town == "Cape Town"])

```

Difference in means: `r mean_diff`

```{r}

ttest <- 
  t.test(sugar ~ town, data = malva, alternative = "less")

```

$t$-statistics: `r round(ttest$statistic, 3)`

## The $t$-distribution under the Null

```{r}

df <- 
  tibble(t = seq(-5, 5, by = 0.01), df = ttest$parameter) %>% 
  mutate(`t density` = dt(t, df = df))

```

Under the Null, the distribution of $t$-statistics is the $t$ distribution (looks like a "narrower" normal distribution):

```{r}

ggplot(df, aes(x = t, y = `t density`)) +
  geom_area(fill = "mediumvioletred", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = ttest$statistic, col = "mediumvioletred")

```

. . .

It is VERY unlikely to observe such a large $t$ statistics assuming that the two average sugar contents are the same between the two towns.

## The $p$-value

Remember: The $p$-value is the **probability** of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one we observed, *under the Null hypothesis*.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-height: 4
ggplot(df, aes(x = t, y = `t density`)) +
  geom_area(fill = "mediumvioletred", alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_area(data = df |> filter(t > 2), fill = "midnightblue") +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2, col = "mediumvioletred") 

```

## The $t$-test

What we just did is called a $t$-test.

. . .

The assumptions for a $t$-test are:

-   the two populations follow a normal distribution OR

-   the sample sizes are larger than \~40 in each group

. . .

⚠️ Were we allowed to do a $t$-test for the pudding data?

## Normal Malva?

Did we have more than 40 samples in each group?

. . . Were our data normally distributed?

. . .

```{r}
g_malva_hist
```

## QQ-what?

. . .

A more formal way to check that data are normally distributed is to make a QQ-plot.

. . .

```{r}
#| fig-height: 3.5
ggplot(malva, aes(sample = sugar, colour = town)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = town_colors)

```

If the dots are close to the line, that indicates that the data is compatible with a normal distribution.

$\rightarrow$ We can use the $t$-test ✅

## The $t$-test in R

In `R`, we can do a $t$-test using the function `t.test`.

```{r}
#| echo: true

t.test(sugar ~ town, data = malva, alternative = "greater")

```

## 🫵 Hands-on exercises {.your-turn}

Read the Module 6 Quarto document and execute all chunks until the "data transformation" section.

## 🙅 Enough Pudding! Let's science 🧪

Our 1st scientific question is:

"Does IL-1$\beta$" (a cytokine) have a different concentration in samples from individuals diagnosed with BV (bacterial vaginosis) or not?"

. . .

What is the Null and Alternative hypothesis?

. . .

$$H_0: \mu_{BV} = \mu_{H} $$

$$H_a: \mu_{BV} \neq \mu_{H}$$

## Let's display the data

```{r}

elisa <- 
  read_csv(
    "data/03_elisa_cytokines_UKZN_workshop_2023.csv"
    )

IL1b <- elisa |> filter(cytokine == "IL-1b") 


cytokine_lim_cols <-
  c("within limits" = "navy", "out of range" = "indianred1")


ggplot(IL1b, aes(x = conc, fill = limits)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 100) +
  ggtitle("IL-1b concentrations") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cytokine_lim_cols)

```

Does this look normal?

. . .

What should we do?

## Data transformation

```{r}
#| echo: true
IL1b <- IL1b |> mutate(logconc = log10(conc))

```

```{r}
ggplot(IL1b, aes(x = logconc, fill = limits)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30) +
  ggtitle("IL-1b concentrations (log 10)") +
  xlab("log10(conc)")  +
  scale_fill_manual(values = cytokine_lim_cols)
```

Does this look normal?

## QQ-plot

```{r}

ggplot(
  IL1b, 
  aes(sample = logconc)
) +
  geom_qq_line() +
  geom_qq(size = 0.75, alpha = 0.5)

```

Not perfect, but not too bad.

## IL-1$\beta$ by BV status

```{r}


clin <- 
  read_csv(
    "data/02_visit_clinical_measurements_UKZN_workshop_2023.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )


clin <- 
  clin |> 
  mutate(BV = ifelse(nugent_score >= 7, "BV", "Healthy")) 

sample_info <- 
  read_csv(
    file = "data/00_sample_ids_UKZN_workshop_2023.csv",
    show_col_types = FALSE
  )


IL1b <- 
  IL1b |> 
  left_join(sample_info, by = join_by(sample_id)) |> 
  left_join(clin, by = join_by(pid, time_point, arm))


```

```{r}


BV_colors <- 
  c("BV" = "darkgoldenrod1", "Healthy" = "cornflowerblue")

ggplot(
  IL1b, #|> filter(limits == "within limits"),
  aes(x = logconc, fill = BV)
) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, alpha = 0.5, position = "identity") +
  xlab("log10(conc)") +
  ggtitle("IL-1b concentration by BV diagnosis") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = BV_colors)

```

## $t$-test?

```{r}
#| echo: true
IL1b |> count(BV) |> pivot_wider(names_from = BV, values_from = n)
```

. . .

The data roughly follow a normal distribution AND we have more than 40 samples in each group, so we can use a $t$-test:

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

t.test(logconc ~ BV, data = IL1b)

```

## 🫵 Hands-on exercises {.your-turn}

Continue on the Module 6 Quarto document and execute all chunks until the "Non-parametric tests" section.

## What if?

😬 What if the $t$-test assumptions weren't met?

. . .

✅ We can use another test such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test

## Parametric *vs* non-parametric tests

The $t$-test is a **parametric** test.

. . .

🤔 What does it mean?

. . .

It assumes that the populations can be described by a distribution characterized by a few **parameters** (*e.g.*, mean and standard deviation).

For example: the Normal distribution: $N(\mu, \sigma^2)$

## Non-parametric tests

Non-parametric tests do not make any assumption about the distribution of the data.

. . .

The "equivalent" of the $t$-test is the **Mann-Whitney U test** or the **Wilcoxon rank sum test**.

. . .

In `R`, we can use the `wilcox.test` function to run this test.

## Why not always use non-parametric tests?

Because these tests have **less power** than parametric tests.

. . .

The **power** of a test is the *probability* of rejecting the Null hypothesis when it is false.

. . .

It is the ability of a test to detect small but real effects.

## 🫵 Hands-on exercises {.your-turn}

Continue on the Module 6 Quarto document and execute all chunks until the "Multiple testing" section.

## ☕️ BREAK

## Hypothesis testing: summary

::: incremental
-   ☝️ The first and most important step is to have a clear and testable **scientific question**.

-   ⚖️ Then, one can define the **null and alternative hypotheses**.

-   ❓Depending on the question and the hypotheses, one must pick an appropriate **statistical test** or **model**.

    -   🙋 For complex questions/models, it might be necessary to consult a statistician.

-   🧑‍💻 Most common tests have been implemented in `R`. Read their documentation carefully and check their assumptions.
:::

## What about other cytokines?

🤔 Can we repeat the same test we did for IL-1$\beta$ for all the other cytokines?

. . .

🚨 Yes, but be careful about **multiple testing**!

## Multiple testing

Remember the $p$-value definition:

The $p$-value is the **probability** of observing a test statistic as extreme as the one we observed, *under the Null hypothesis*.

. . .

If this probability is smaller than, let's say 1/20 (0.05), we reject the Null hypothesis. But we still have 1 chance / 20 to be wrong!

. . .

So, as we perform many tests, we are more likely to obtain small $p$-values by chance.

## 🫵 Hands-on exercises {.your-turn}

Explore the effects of multiple testing using simulations and check the `p.adjust` function and the `p.adjust.methods`.

Continue on the Module 6 Quarto document and execute all chunks until the "Displaying longitudinal data" section.

## ➡️➡️➡️ Longitudinal design

Remember the study design of the data we are analyzing:

![](images/study_design.png){fig-alt="The study design" fig-align="center" width="546"}

. . .

Should we try to display the data in a way that highlights the "trajectories" of participants along the study?

## 🧠 Remember: `left_join`

First, we need to join the cytokine data with the sample data so we have the study arm and the time-point for each sample:

```{r}
#| echo: true

elisa <- 
  elisa |> 
  mutate(logconc = log10(conc)) |> 
  left_join(sample_info, by = join_by(sample_id))

elisa |> head() 

```

## 🎁 Bonus: `character` string manipulation

Since we'll want to display the visit data, we can "polish" the labels of the `time-point` column so that they read nicely.

Right now, the visit labels are:

```{r}

elisa$time_point |> unique() 

```

. . .

We can use the `str_replace` function from the `stringr` package to replace the underscores with spaces:

```{r}
#| echo: true

elisa <- 
  elisa |> 
  mutate(time_point = time_point |> str_replace("_", " "))

elisa$time_point |> unique()
```

## 🧠 Remember: `factor`

```{r}

elisa |> head() 

```

Which columns should be converted to factors?

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

elisa <- 
  elisa |> 
  mutate(
    sample_id = sample_id |> factor(),
    cytokine = cytokine |> factor(),
    pid = pid |> factor(),
    time_point =time_point |> factor(),
    arm = arm |> factor(),
    limits = limits |> factor()
    )

```

## IL-1$\beta$ longitudinal patterns

```{r}
#| echo: true

elisa |> 
  filter(cytokine == "IL-1b") |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = time_point, y = logconc, color = arm)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = pid), alpha = 0.75) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Visits") +
  ylab("log10(IL-1b concentration)") +
  scale_color_manual("Arm", values = c("deeppink","steelblue1"))

```

## 🫵 Hands-on exercises {.your-turn}

Continue on the Module 6 Quarto document and execute all chunks until the "Compositional data" section.

🎁 Bonus: there is a section on "paired tests" that you can read if you want to learn more about the paired $t$-test and the Wilcoxon signed rank test.

## ☯ Compositional data

What are compositional data?

. . .

Multivariate data are compositional when the variables are expressed as proportions of a whole.

. . .

Remember the *flow cytometry* data?

Sometimes, data are expressed as "proportions of cells X among all cells".

## ⚠️ What's the problem with compositional data?

. . .

The proportions are not independent.

. . .

If we have 3 cell types (A, B, and C) and in one condition, only cells A increase in number, when expressed "compositionally", it may look like cells B and C are decreasing.

. . .

```{r}
#| echo: true

condition_1 <- c("A" = 102, "B" = 239, "C" = 163)
condition_2 <- condition_1
condition_2["A"] <- condition_2["A"] + 78 # we only increase A

(condition_1/sum(condition_1)) |> round(digits = 2)
(condition_2/sum(condition_2)) |> round(digits = 2) # but the % of B and C decrease!

```

## Potential solutions

There is no "one-size-fits-all" for compositional data.

. . .

In some cases, some smart solutions have been proposed.

. . .

For example, for RNA-seq data, the `DESeq2` package uses a "regularized log" transformation that allows to use standard statistical tests.

That transformation assumes that most genes are not differentially expressed but that only works for datasets with a large number of features.

## 📆 See you at the next workshop!
